#this is an html ref sheet

"id" = 'Var' is on way to put identifier on things:
    it gotta begin with (a-z,A-Z)
    once things are id, typically you Manip it with a scripting lingo:
        DOM method 'getElementById()' can get you an element
    things that have an identifier.(id) can be called in style sheet,
    import Ex()>
        id="Paragraph1"#this is in html
        #Paragraph1 {color:blue}#this is the css callback
    Exit()<
    Once something has the id tag it can become an anchor,
    or a hyperlink:
        It can become clickable and can jump to other lines in your program
    import EX()>
        <a href='#mainContent'>Skip to this content</a>#this would be the ancho9r ref and now its clickable, the # is need for the link
        <div id='mainContent'>This is the content of this page</div>#this is the actual ref
    Exit()<
    One thing about the id attr is the naming convetion:
        its easy to get the names mixed up since this can work with code, txt, pics, also std funcs might have the name of,
        a var you want to use
    #yall get why im a python/c type of guy lmaooooo. this is just html
    #*id a headache ima tackle it and make some buttons and alerts when I code.
    #* and put it on an Element

You can add "Style".(like css) with html:
    you can add:
        font(size)
        import Ex()>
            <strong style = "font-family: Arial;#you add thie semi after ever arguement
            font-size: 18px;">Example</strong>
        Exit()<
"Title" are kinda cool:
    you can add em to elements:
        import Ex()>
            <p title = "Hey look I am a title tooltip!">
                This is some text
            </p>
        Exit()<
    When you over you mouse over this text itll read the title
    #*      |*********************SIDE NOTE(so i dont forget what this do)***************|
            I wonder if I can put the title over my mouse and have it do some cool effects

    #*

This is still a text file so you change the lang,
or the keyboard output:
    the < dir=> attr is how to call it
"lang" is also an attr that can be called but you gotta know the lang extentsion
