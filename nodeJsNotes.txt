#This is starting at Dynamic responses
Dynamic Resonses:
    Dynamic responses is really dealing with real time request:
	Ima assume static is for more local Networks
#also after reading all this stuff APIS seems like psudo-OS or shells. 
#they handle really just handle request. Ima assume me making that Server is an API
#when I make a User Interface that is an API
    API really is the thing that pulls the data:
	with proper authorization it would get you anything(Shouts out to the security ring)
#looking at some ones likes or recent history(from your device) is basically what web APIs do
    with the right lines of code you can make an API do certain style funtion:
	Refer(Server2.js).
